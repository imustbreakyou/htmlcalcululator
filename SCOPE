Functions: Add Subtract Multiply and Divide
A calculator operation will consist of a number, an operator, and another number. For example, 3 + 5. Create three variables for each of the parts of a calculator operation. Create a variable for the first number, the operator, and the second number. You’ll use these variables to update your display later.
oeprate function wioll take 2 numbers and calls an above funciton on each
create html caclulator 
Store first and second number in caclulator utilize the operator that the user selects 


 update the display with the solution and problem, store result as first number

 Extra considerations: Users should be able to string together several operations and get the right answer, with each pair of numbers being evaluated at a time.

 Your calculator should not evaluate more than a single pair of numbers at a time. 

 You should round answers with long decimals so that they don’t overflow the screen.

 Pressing = before entering all of the numbers or an operator could cause problems!

 Pressing “clear” should wipe out any existing data.. make sure the user is really starting fresh after pressing “clear”

 Display a snarky error message if the user tries to divide by 0… and don’t let it crash your calculator!

  Add a . button and let users input decimals! Make sure you don’t let them type more than one though: 12.3.56.5. It is hard to do math on these numbers. (disable the decimal button if there’s already one in the display)
